This is a full-stack framework project built using Django, Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. My goal is to create a functioning and responsive website, that allows users to post, comment and like or unlike recipes. This project has been built for educational purposes.

# About
The Healthy Family is a website where users can comment, like and view recipes and also share their own recipes with other users.
This page is intended for all parents and others who are looking for inspiration in preparing meals for their children.

This website will offer all of these things whilst also allowing for intuitive navigation and conformability of use.

# Structure
 
Since our target audience is mostly moms, but also everyone else who is looking for inspiration in preparing meals for children the structure idea
for The Healthy Family was to keep it simple. Simplicity helps users to quickly and easily access the app and navigate within the app.

The website is made from one app:
- recipes
